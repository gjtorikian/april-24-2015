100 years of #ArmenianGenocide denial means 100 tweets about it. These are automated from http://git.io/vfzxA #100YearsOfDenial
The other day someone tried talking to me about ErdoÄŸan & the modern Turk, the vigorous and various genocide denials.
I responded by saying I'm not that kind of Armenian. I've felt guilty ever since.
The truth is, I *am* that kind of Armenian. Most people with a drop of Armenian blood grow up to be "that kind of Armenian."
When I was a kid, maybe 8 or 9, I was certain that malicious Turks still wanted to explode a bomb and destroy our school.
What other result can be expected when you're taught that there's an entire horde of people who wanted your ancestors dead?
The bitter truth, though, is that there's a perpetual genocide going on in many places around the world, every day.
Those murders are silent, too. Committed in silence, silently ignored.
That's why refusing to acknowledge one injustice is a tacit acceptance of every other. One crime unforgiven emboldens others.
We were told to remember which countries our grandparents emigrated to. We were categorized based on a family's adopted home
If you could trace your lineage past your grandparents, you were beyond lucky.
But luck had nothing to do with survival. Your great-grandparents always suffered greatly for the chance at life.
Miller once wrote that the disease of the 20th century was schizophrenia.
The modern Armenian is doomed to suffer an eternal schizophrenia.
You are neither here nor there. You are neither American nor French nor Argentinian nor Canadian nor Egyptian nor Russian.
You are never Armenian but you are never your adopted country, either.
Many will rage at that. Few will look upon it with liberation.
Because nationalism and race are absolute bullshit.
Borders are lines drawn in the sand by generals with swords.
Cultural identity is the thing you're meant to defend after "surviving" a genocide.
But identity wielded poorly is precisely the tool that's used to instigate genocide.
Identity should mean you're confident enough to not let past circumstances dissuade you from making new choices.
Identity should mean you're aware of what's happened and empowered to make a difference.
So many people use their Armenian identity as an excuse to stay miserable or spiteful.
Wallowing in sadness doesn't change the past. It only ruins your future.
Enough about philosophy, though. Let's get down to some facts. Fact: many Armenians died between 1880 and 1920.
Fact: much of pretty much every Armenian family in the region was displaced.
Fact: people are harassed and challenged *to this day* when trying to state these truths.
Fact: systems in power categorically deny any wrongdoing to stay in power, whether their sin was one week or 100 years ago.
Fact: systems in power will fabricate the truth to fit their own narrative.
People died and now people lie about it. All the time.
Maybe in another 100 years the event will be so far out of our consciousness that it won't matter if it's a truth or not.
Just look at the massacres of Native Americans for proof of how time heals all wounds.
What, exactly, though, is modern Turkey afraid of?
Do they worry that reparations are in order? Will we demand our mountain back?
Most cities of a certain size have a fairly prominent Armenian genocide memorial.
Montebello's tower, we'd visit nearly every year. Lots of families did. There were always prayers with a moment of silence.
Yerevan's torch is very grandiose. A pit of fire alongside an obelisk with a schism sliced through it.
Montreal's sculpture is a single slab of marble. Perpetual reminders, they called it.
San Francisco's memorial is a cross is on top of the highest natural point in the city.
Every one has a plaque repeating those same sordid details: "Between such and such years such and such things happened."
But not a single person I've listened to or spoken with has ever mentioned any expectation of money, land, or property.
There's something to be said about the pride of Armenians here, for sure.
It has nothing to do with the material atonement. There's nothing to be gained here. There's no coin to be won.
It's about respect. And justice. An unfailing pursuit of the truth.
If you're a system in power and your words are already meaningless, why not utter the words millions of people expect?
It's much simpler to say "Sorry" than it is to perpetuate "It didn't happen."
For me, that's the greatest aggravation of it all. The denial, not the event. The lies, not the truth.
But, of course, don't think that only the aggressor is at fault here.
In '96, I remember the Dole campaign sending postcards to every Armenian family in an effort to campaign for more votes.
The gist of the message was: "You're Armenian! Vote for me, and I'll make sure America recognizes the genocide!"
Dole didn't win, of course, and I wondered if the opportunity for recognition forever slipped through our collective hands.
I didn't have to wait long for an answer. In '00, Bush tried the exact same tactic. And *he* won.
Yet, the States made no formal recognition. Nor has it ever.
Obama performed the exact same tactic. And although he acknowledges the facts, he's stopped using the term "genocide."
(A word, by the way, that was invented *as a result of* the Armenian genocide.)
Israel, too, has yet to recognize the Armenian genocide.
All these refusals stem from a simple fact: Turkey is a powerful entity in the region. Do what they ask at the cost of facts
The hands of no country is clean. But the perpetual washing is absolutely sickening.
But enough about just us. Let's talk about now.
Just 20 years after the fact, we needed to invent a new word for a sort of mega-genocide. It's called a *holocaust*.
Since the 20th century, genocides are decided and occur on a monthly basis. A daily basis.
One needn't wait for another 100 yrs. Every 100 days, some group will get in their heads that mass murder is right.
Sudanese. Aboriginals. Tibetans. Mexicans. Bosnians. Kurds. Chinese. Palestinians.
That anyone can list this many off the top of their heads from the last decade or two is revolting.
Systematic murder is a reality for many millions of men, women, and children.
The fear I had that bombs would blow me up as a child are fears that children experience right now.
Don't assume an over-exaggeration when I say that refusal of acknowledgement of one genocide is an acceptance of others.
When any group or person comes up with a reason for why they're better than another group or person, the game's over.
Just know that the average citizen of any state probably opts to stay away from violence. At least, I certainly hope so.
The people who profit most from conflict death are the ones who seek to ensure its continuance.
There's little that can be done to stop a genocide occurring right now, other than making it real by talking about it.
Other than accepting its facts, there's nothing that can be done for a genocide a hundred years (or more) prior.
But there is always hope.
The hope right now is that at some point we'll be able to look beyond differences that entice us to hate and stupidity.
We'll look past gender, past color, past sexuality, past nationality, past creed.
The goal of living, I always thought, was to evolve into better creatures.
Just as monkeys became humans, so too will the human become something more. Maybe an angel. Or at least a less stupid human.
But as long as we perpetuate a system of stupidity and base it on a cycle of greed and revenge, we'll never become better.
The Armenians, at any rate, must accept the possibility that they might never get the attention they deserve.
And that, in the loosest sense of the word, should be "fine".
The same way it should be understood and "fine" that no other massacred group unmentioned & unknown will get any attention.
The same way it's also "fine" that we're nationless, borderless. Free to cross over any boundary and become something more.
If the systems in power don't want to acknowledge an atrocity, the least we can do is remember that it happened.
Words and the repetition of our stories are something that can never be lost, if you truly want to keep an idea.
Let others deny and obscure and ignore facts, on the micro and macro scales.
That they do it does not make them acceptable. That you let them does not mean you are passive.
Never mistake patience for passiveness. Never mistake silence for ignorance.
Memories, fortunately, cannot yet be wiped. Memories are strong. And they last many more years past whomever is in charge.
And one day, when we become more than we are, the memories will be useful.
Until then, we're all going to have to wait.
"Tradition is a beautiful graveyard."
Don't let the past drag on like a ball and chain.
Become more than what you think you can become.
I guarantee that perpetrators of hate and denial will eventually change their minds or die with their obsolete opinions.
100 years of lies is equatable to 100 seconds of lies. And neither one is acceptable.
Stand for what's actually right, not what other people tell you what's right.
Love the people around you, especially the ones who aren't like you.
Remember that we laugh and dance and eat, too. Remember, too, that there's so much more to remember.
It's really the only way to repay the gift of life we were given. #100YearsOfDenial #ArmenianGenocide
